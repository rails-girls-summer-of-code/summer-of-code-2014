My name is Laura Wadden and I’m a Graduate Developer for ThoughtWorks, a world-wide software consulting firm.
I started my journey with coding when I moved to Berlin from San Francisco in September 2012.

I first stumbled upon the Rails Girls community last May and attended my first beginners workshop.
The energy was electric and I immediately found a supportive community. There I heard about Rails Girls
Summer of Code -- a 3-month, paid program for beginners to work on open source projects and learn to code.

The next few months changed my life. I met Duana Stanley, a former ThoughtWorks employee,
who became my mentor for everything from TDD to working as a software developer. The summer was
difficult, rewarding and quick. I asked myself, “What comes next?”

I participated in Open Tech School’s Hackerhsip, another community program in Berlin.
By the end of Hackership, I was ready for a junior developer position or internship, but I never imagined
I was ready for a firm like ThoughtWorks.

I gave a presentation at a meetup in Berlin about my Hackerhsip project in d3.js, and
a ThoughtWorks employee was in the audience. She heard my repeated plug, “I’m looking for a job!”
and she sent my name to the ThoughtWorks recruiting team. The next day I had a message in my inbox.

“You really want me?”

“Yes,” the recruiter said. She explained about ThoughtWorks’ Graduate Developer program.

Her explanation can mostly be found on the website here: [link]. The following is
my experience as a Rails Girls Summer of Code alumnus, native English speaker and US-American.
It might come as no surprise, but even with all of the support and help along the way this is a ton of work.

The Graduate Program has two main aspects - training and on-the-job support.


## Training
Graduates attend a 5-week training program in Pune, India. It has classroom sessions,
project work and individual performance coaching and review. The goal is to help new
employees understand ThoughtWorks as a company and help develop core skills to effectively perform your role.
For me personally, this meant intensive training in test driven development (TDD), pair programming, and
experience working on a real client project. Not to mention, I met people from around the world because each
office of 17 sends participants.

Before I left for the program I completed a (long and difficult) programming assignment
to prepare me for the coursework to come. ThoughtWorks provided mentors and was open to
questions. During that time I leaned heavily on my mentor Duana and the Rails Girls community.
I couldn’t do it alone and many people helped me along the way.

In India it was an intensive experience. There were sessions during the day, client
project work, and I studied programming concepts at night via various homework assignments.


## On-the-job support
When I came back from ThoughtWorks University, I wasn’t sure how I would be supported next.
These two aspects helped me succeed in my first six months:



## The Beach & Shadowing
Employees who aren’t working on client projects are “On the Beach”. During this time
they can shadow ongoing projects, work on pro-bono projects, or simply learn. For a
new developer this is especially helpful because I had space and opportunities to develop new skills.
I shadowed on a project for my first 2 months and now am assigned to that project.



## Culture of Continuous Learning & Sharing
ThoughtWorks loves learning and teaching. There is a personal development budget
for books, workshops, conferences or online courses. During my project I’ve held one-off
sessions on CSS or other technical concepts and participated in a Design Patterns book club.
Since these opportunities are usually included in work time, I’m not overwhelmed with studying at night.

These are just a few notes on my experience and of course there’s more to say.
Luckily I’m a real person and I would love to learn more about your experience.
Please reach out to me and I’d be happy to help or connect you with someone who can.

Are you interested in ThoughtWorks? That’s great! Feel free to reach out to me our
Verena Traub, a recruiter for ThoughtWorks. She can connect you to the appropriate
office around the world or answer any of your questions.
