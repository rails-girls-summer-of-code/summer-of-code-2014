On the last day of the Summer of Code, we presented a special surprise to our six Volunteer Teams.

If you remember, volunteer teams are teams that showed great potential and support, but couldn't be offered a sponsored spot in the Summer of Code.

Working on an Open Source project for 3 months without any pay is a huge feat, and one which didn't escape us, as we observed them over the Summer.

With the help of O'Reilly Verlag, and Code School, we were able to send the Volunteer Teams of 2014 something special to thank them for being a part of the program, and spur them on as the dig deeper into code.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Thank you for the CodeSchool subscription <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsSoC">@RailsGirlsSoC</a> !!I can&#39;t wait to try out their node.js and javascript courses! Love you guys!! &lt;3</p>&mdash; Akshata Mohan (@AkshataDM) <a href="https://twitter.com/AkshataDM/status/517347127639285762">October 1, 2014</a></blockquote>

From O'Reilly, each volunteer team member was given a free e-book of their choice from the German or English online stores. This should help our volunteers find some terrific reading material on subjects of interests.

Code School kindly gifted volunteer participants each a 3-month subscription, for full access to all Code School online tutorials. With three months to take advantage of,

How amazing, is that?!

When we let O'Reilly and Code School know we would be writing this blog post to thank them, they let us know how happy it made them just to contribute.

We hope this small gift makes a lasting impression on our volunteer teams as they finished up the Summer/Winter, and that they will enjoy some tools for extra learning.
