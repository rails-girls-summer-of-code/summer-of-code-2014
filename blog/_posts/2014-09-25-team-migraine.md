## About Me

My name is [Rocio Paez](http://www.rociopaez.com), I've been working on technology related logistics my entire professional life (I was very bored). And I always loved working with computers.
In november 2014 I took a 3-month course on HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I loved it.
I discovered how a website is built, and the proper way to give styles to a page.  
I wanted to keep learning, so I quit my job and decided to learn Ruby and apply to the Rails Girls Summer of Code 2014.

One of my hobbies is dancing flamenco, I've danced every night (Mon-Sat) since 2007, it’s my passion.  
At 32 years old I discovered that I have a second passion, and it is programming. It came at a time in my life I felt discouraged because I did not love my job, and I did not know what was what I really wanted to do for the life, I am now happy to start working as a programmer.

## My Project

I suffer from migraines, so I thought it would be interesting to develop an application for migraine and to learn to program doing this application.
The app attempts to help understand the processes of migraines more clearly.
In the app we have inputs and outputs. Inputs are all that you put in your body like food and beverages or the way you feel, your mood, etc. You can configure your input types.
Outputs are the headaches and measure a pain score and a duration.

## My Coaches and Supervisor

I have 2 coaches, one is my husband :) [Gustavo Beathtaye](https://github.com/goddamnhippie) and the other one is [Francesco Rodríguez](https://github.com/frodsan). My supervisor is [Susanne Dewen](https://github.com/FrauBienenstich).  
Our way of working was through Campfire, but have now we discovered Gitter, the platform is very cool, works with Github, and you can even write code in the chat window.

[Gitter.im](https://gitter.im/) I recommend it!

This photo is one of the meetings (to talk about the plan for the app, in Barranco, Lima - Peru)

## Framework

This app was initially made ​​with Rails, but we wanted to try a different framework: [Cuba](http://cuba.is).
It was quite interesting to learn Cuba, to know how it operates.
But now I'm interested in learning how Rails works. So, after I finish my app, I'll rewrite it with Rails.

## My Training

I applied initially with a partner, but she had a problem and could not continue. I would have liked a partner, I think would have been more fun and the app could be more complete. But when I started the program on July 1st, it was quite fun and exciting.  
I remember my early days, the slow progress I was making and posting about it.
One of the things I loved was when I did my first pull request, it was pretty exciting to contribute to open source.
I had to remember how to use CSS too.  
What has taken me longer to learn is to know the difference between class and instance methods.  

This summer of code ends next week, I'll keep learning, I have many plans in mind.

Thanks!
