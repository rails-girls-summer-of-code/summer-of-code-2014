                <h2>Women go Open Source</h2>
                <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code helps Rails Girls students get into Open Source.</p>
                <p>Just like in Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code, students will be paid so they're free to work on Open Source projects for a few months. Unlike those programs, the Rails Girls Summer of Code is about helping students to further expand their knowledge and skills by contributing to a great Open Source project (rather than producing highly sophisticated code).</p>

                <h2>Projects wanted!</h2>
                <p>The ideal project for the Rails Girls Summer of Code defines a goal that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>can be considered a valuable, significant contribution</li>
                    <li>is simple enough that a beginner will be able to complete it in a time frame of three months or less</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each project needs to provide a mentor, who will help the student get up to speed with the project and provide feedback and direction. Mentors will be supported by coaches (developers based in the same city as the student, helping them to accomplish their tasks), so the workload for a mentor is limited.</p>
