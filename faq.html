                <a name="1"></a><h3>What is Rails Girls Summer of Code?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code (RGSoC) helps Rails Girls* students get into Open Source.</p>
                  <p>Just like in Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code, students will be paid so they're free to work on Open Source projects for a few months. Unlike those programs, the Rails Girls Summer of Code is about helping students to further expand their knowledge and skills by contributing to a great Open Source project (rather than producing highly sophisticated code). </p>
                  <p><i>*or students from another comparable workshop</i></p>
                </div>
                <a name="1b"></a><h3>Is it a global initiative?</h3>
                <div>
                  Yes! Rails Girls Summer of Code is happening worldwide and students from all over the world are welcome to apply.
                </div>
                <a name="2"></a><h3>Who is running this?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p> The initiative is a community-driven one, so RGSoC is run by volunteers all over the world. Amazing people helping as organizers, coaches, mentors, supervisors are making this happen. You can too: Send an email to <a href="mailto:summer-of-code@railsgirls.com">summer-of-code@railsgirls.com</a> and join the international team!</p>
                </div>
                <a name="3"></a><h3>Who can participate as a student?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>We're looking for women who have participated in any Rails Girls, RailsBridge, or similar newcomer workshop, have participate in a Ruby/Rails study group, or otherwise are getting started with Ruby/Rails as newcomers.</p>
                    <p>Unlike Google Summer of Code, no status as a student at a university is necessary, and there are certainly no degree or age limitations.</p>
                    <p>This initiative is focused on bringing more women into the world of open source. Men are not excluded however women are given priority.</p>
                </div>
                <a name="4"></a><h3>Where will Rails Girls Summer of Code take place?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>Since Rails Girls Summer of Code is an international initiative, there is no one "place" where everything happens. It depends on where students live and want to work</p>
                  <p>We will try to help find coaches as near as possible to a students location to avoid the student having to accomodate herself in a different city. Ideally coaches can provide a desk at their own workplace so students can sit next to them, ask questions and get support.</p>
