                <h3>What is Rails Girls Summer of Code?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code helps Rails Girls students get into Open Source.</p>
                  <p>Just like in Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code, students will be paid so they're free to work on Open Source projects for a few months. Unlike those programs, the Rails Girls Summer of Code is about helping students to further expand their knowledge and skills by contributing to a great Open Source project (rather than producing highly sophisticated code).</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Who is running this?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>The idea for this project originated in a Berlin Rails Girls organizers and coaches meeting about exchanging ideas about "what's happening after the initial beginner's workshop" and what could be improved. One idea was to encourage students to get involved with open source projects. And so the idea for a summer of code was born.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Who can participate as a student?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>We're looking for women who have participated in any Rails Girls, RailsBridge, or similar newcomer workshop, have participate in a Ruby/Rails study group, or otherwise are getting started with Ruby/Rails as newcomers.</p>
                    <p>Unlike Google Summer of Code, no status as a student at a university is necessary, and there are certainly no degree or age limitations.</p>
                    <p>This initiative is focused on bringing more women into the world of open source. Men are not excluded however women are given priority.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Where will Rails Girls Summer of Code take place?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code is planned as a global event. Thus, it does not matter where a student or coach lives or where a company is located.</p>
                  <p>We will try to find coaches as near as possible to a students location to avoid the student having to accomodate herself in a different city. Ideally coaches can provide a desk at their own workplace so students can sit next to them, ask questions and get support.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>How much money will students receive?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>Has to be decided. GSoC paid 1500 USD a month, for 3 month.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Why are mentor and coach two separate roles?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>Just like in Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code each project needs at least one person who knows the project very well and can decide on directions, goals and tasks. This role has traditionally been named "mentors". </p>
                    <p>Unlike those programs Rails Girls Summer of Code has a primarily educational and motivational purpose though. Thus, students are going to be supported by coaches who will support and aid students in accomplishing their tasks. A coach should be located in the same city as the student is. Ideally they can share a desk so support is available at all times.</p>
                    <p>So, in Rails Girls Summer of Code mentors take the role of being the expert goto person on the project side. Coaches take the role of supporting students in learning and achieving the project goals.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>What does an ideal project goal look like?</h3>

                <h3>This is awesome. How can I get involved?</h3>

                <h3>I'm sponsoring Rails Girls Summer of Code. What about VAT and tax deduction for my donations?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>We don't really know about tax laws everywhere in the world but according to our tax advisor: "Contributions and payments to Rails Girls Summer of Code are not deductible as charitable contributions for federal income tax purposes. However, they may be deductible under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (for US) or your local tax authority's advice."</p>
                  <p>A word about VAT. Sorry to bother you - we'll keep a long story short. If you're not from Europe (to be precise - from the EU) you can skip this. For all the others: we have to struggle with the odd EU VAT regulations for the above mentioned packages. During you fill out the form and entered an EU country we will show a field to ask for your VAT ID. If you have one please enter it - otherwise your contribution will be reduced by 19% VAT. You come from Germany? We will show you a field to ask if VAT is a recoverable tax for you. If so, we will add the 19% VAT to your contribution and ask you to complete your address data.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>What happens if we don't reach our goal?</h3>
                <div>
                  Summer of Code will offer a reduced amount of spots to students. We currently account for raising
                  $5000 per student. So if we raise $30,000 we have enough money to fund 6 students.
                </div>
                <h3>What happens to my donations if Summer of Code does not go ahead?</h3>
                <div>
                  If for some reason the Summer of Code can't go ahead as planned, donors will be offered a refund of
                  their donation. Alternatively you can decide to have your donation go to the Rails Girls
                  organization to share your donation with other, future Rails Girls events across the globe.
                </div>
                <h3>What happens with any left-over money from the 2013 Summer of Code?</h3>
                <div>
                  Any money left over from the campaign will be saved for next year's Rails Girls Summer of Code.
                  Should there be no Summer of Code in 2014, the Rails Girls organization will decide how to best
                  spend any left over donation money.
